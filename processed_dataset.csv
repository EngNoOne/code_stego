	   input validation is a frequently-used technique
	   for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to
	   ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the
	   code, or when communicating with other components.  when
	   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is
	   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by
	   the rest of the application. this will lead to parts of the
	   system receiving unintended input, which may result in
	   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or
	   arbitrary code execution.
	   input validation is not the only technique for
	   processing input, however.  other techniques attempt to
	   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such
	   as filtering (cwe-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous
	   inputs - or encoding/escaping (cwe-116), which attempts to
	   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included
	   in output to another component. other techniques exist as well
	   (see cwe-138 for more examples.)
	   input validation can be applied to:
	   
	     raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.
	     metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size
	   
	   data can be simple or structured.  structured data
	   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of
	   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or
	   structured data.
	   many properties of raw data or metadata may need
	   to be validated upon entry into the code, such
	   as:
	   
	     specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.
	     implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size
	     indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures
	     symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.
	     well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax 
	     lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token
	     specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)
	     consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.
	     conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic 
	     equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same
	     authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data
	   
	   implied or derived properties of data must often
	   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  errors in
	   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor
	   to improper input validation.
	   
	   note that ""input validation"" has very different
	   meanings to different people, or within different
	   classification schemes.  caution must be used when
	   referencing this cwe entry or mapping to it.  for example,
	   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control
	   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able
	   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred
	   to as input validation.
	   finally, it is important to emphasize that the
	   distinctions between input validation and output escaping
	   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to
	   understand the difference, including how input validation
	   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,
	   especially when less stringent data types must be
	   supported, such as free-form text. consider a sql injection
	   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a
	   query. the name ""o'reilly"" would likely pass the validation
	   step since it is a common last name in the english
	   language. however, this valid name cannot be directly
	   inserted into the database because it contains the ""'""
	   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or
	   otherwise transformed. in this case, removing the
	   apostrophe might reduce the risk of sql injection, but it
	   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name
	   would be recorded.

            in the inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. this hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. if the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

cwe-284,improper access control,the product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.,"
            access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:
            
               authentication (proving the identity of an actor)
               authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and
               accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)
            
            when any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.
            there are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
               
                  specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). this action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
                  enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect acl to produce insecure settings). this problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

            if a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. the end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.
            in some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. the entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. if the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.
            there are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:

	   cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.
           it is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.
           since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered ""unsafe"" even if it was once thought to be strong. this can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.
	   for a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. first, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

            retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. the key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. it is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. however, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.

            this weakness may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g. because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media). or there might be an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to an e-mail account other than that of the user. there might be no throttling done on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession. the system may send the original password to the user rather than generating a new temporary password. in summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented can often become the system's weakest link that can be misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

		   this weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. the problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.
            there are at least two subtypes of os command injection:
               
				 the application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. it intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. for example, the program might use system(""nslookup [hostname]"") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a hostname, which is used as an argument. attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. however, if the program does not remove command separators from the hostname argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.
				 the application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. the application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. for example, the program might use ""exec([command])"" to execute the [command] that was supplied by the user. if the command is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. if the command is being executed using functions like exec() and createprocess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
               
            from a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. in the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. in the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

cwe-79,improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('cross-site scripting'),the product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.,"
            cross-site scripting (xss) vulnerabilities occur when:
            
               untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.
               the web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.
               during page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as javascript, html tags, html attributes, mouse events, flash, activex, etc.
               a victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.
               since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.
               this effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.
            
            there are three main kinds of xss:
            
               
                  type 1: reflected xss (or non-persistent) - 
         			the server reads data directly from the http request and reflects it back in the http response. reflected xss exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. the most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a url that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. urls constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a url that refers to a vulnerable site. after the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
               
                  type 2: stored xss (or persistent) - 
               the application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. at a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. from an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. if one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. for example, the attacker might inject xss into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.
            
               
                  type 0: dom-based xss - 
               in dom-based xss, the client performs the injection of xss into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. dom-based xss generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. if the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic html), then dom-based xss is possible.
            
            
            once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. the attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. the attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as ""drive-by hacking.""
            in many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as url encoding or unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.

			 outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. this variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. the back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. the programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.

            some glyphs, pictures, or icons can be semantically distinct to a program, while appearing very similar or identical to a human user. these are referred to as homoglyphs. for example, the lowercase ""l"" (ell) and uppercase ""i"" (eye) have different character codes, but these characters can be displayed in exactly the same way to a user, depending on the font. this can also occur between different character sets. for example, the latin capital letter ""a"" and the greek capital letter ""α"" (alpha) are treated as distinct by programs, but may be displayed in exactly the same way to a user. accent marks may also cause letters to appear very similar, such as the latin capital letter grave mark ""à"" and its equivalent ""á"" with the acute accent.
            adversaries can exploit this visual similarity for attacks such as phishing, e.g. by providing a link to an attacker-controlled hostname that looks like a hostname that the victim trusts. in a different use of homoglyphs, an adversary may create a back door username that is visually similar to the username of a regular user, which then makes it more difficult for a system administrator to detect the malicious username while reviewing logs.

	     http agents or components may include a web server, load balancer, reverse proxy, web caching proxy, application firewall, web browser, etc. regardless of the role, they are expected to maintain coherent, consistent http communication state across all components. however, including unexpected data in an http header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the http message that is rendered by the client http agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end http agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response.
	   
            when an http request contains unexpected cr and lf characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as ""splitting"" the stream into two different http messages instead of one. cr is carriage return, also given by %0d or \r, and lf is line feed, also given by %0a or \n.
	    in addition to cr and lf characters, other valid/rfc compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as ht (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \t) and sp (space, also given as + sign or %20).
	    these types of unvalidated and unexpected data in http message headers allow an attacker to control the second ""split"" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.

            improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.
            most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. these structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. for example, ""get /index.html http/1.1"" is a structured message containing a command (""get"") with a single argument (""/index.html"") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (""http/1.1"").
            if an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

      a device's internal information may be accessed through a scan chain of interconnected internal registers, usually through a jtag interface. the jtag interface provides access to these registers in a serial fashion in the form of a scan chain for the purposes of debugging programs running on a device. since almost all information contained within a device may be accessed over this interface, device manufacturers typically insert some form of authentication and authorization to prevent unintended use of this sensitive information. this mechanism is implemented in addition to on-chip protections that are already present.
      if authorization, authentication, or some other form of access control is not implemented or not implemented correctly, a user may be able to bypass on-chip protection mechanisms through the debug interface.
      sometimes, designers choose not to expose the debug pins on the motherboard. instead, they choose to hide these pins in the intermediate layers of the board. this is primarily done to work around the lack of debug authorization inside the chip. in such a scenario (without debug authorization), when the debug interface is exposed, chip internals are accessible to an attacker.

	      cryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of ""primitive"" can vary depending on point of view. see ""terminology notes"" for further explanation of some concepts.
	      cryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. for example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out n different inputs (where the larger the value of n, the stronger the cryptography). for an encryption scheme like aes-256, one would expect n to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.
	      if a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is ""broken""). as a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. a historical example can be found in tls when using des. one would colloquially call des the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of tls. in the past, des was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, des has a key length of 56 bits. trying n=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating des encryption practical. it is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of tls and use this information to attack the system. as a result, it can be claimed that this use of tls is weak, and that any system depending on tls with des could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.

	      cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered.  as a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.
	      if ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.
	      this weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. first, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.

					  an attacker can leverage existing web interface apis, manipulated in such a way that a new user is inserted into the operating system, and the user web account is either partially created or not at all.

                in highly distributed environments, or on systems with distinct physical components that operate independently, there is often a need for each component to store and update its own local copy of key data such as state or cache, so that all components have the same ""view"" of the overall system and operate in a coordinated fashion.  for example, users of a social media service or a massively multiplayer online game might be using their own personal computers while also interacting with different physical hosts in a globally distributed service, but all participants must be able to have the same ""view"" of the world.  alternately, a processor's memory management unit (mmu) might have ""shadow"" mmus to distribute its workload, and all shadow mmus are expected to have the same accessible ranges of memory.

				having mirrored regions with different values might result in the exposure of sensitive information or possibly system compromise.
				in the interest of increased performance, one might need to duplicate a resource. a cache memory is a common example of this concept, which keeps a ""local"" copy of a data element in the high speed cache memory. unfortunately, this speed improvement comes with a downside, since the product needs to ensure that the local copy always mirrors the original copy truthfully. if they get out of sync, the computational result is no longer true.
				during hardware design, memory is not the only item which gets mirrored. there are many other entities that get mirrored, as well: registers, memory regions, and, in some cases, even whole computational units. for example, within a multi-core processor, if all memory accesses for each and every core goes through a single memory-management unit (mmu) then the mmu will become a performance bottleneck. in such cases, duplicating local mmus that will serve only a subset of the cores rather than all of them may resolve the performance issue. these local copies are also called ""shadow copies"" or ""mirrored copies.""
				if the original resource never changed, local duplicate copies getting out of sync would never be an issue. however, the values of the original copy will sometimes change. when the original copy changes, the mirrored copies must also change, and change fast.
				this situation of shadow-copy-possibly-out-of-sync-with-original-copy might occur as a result of multiple scenarios, including the following:
				
						
							after the values in the original copy change, due to some reason the original copy does not send the ""update"" request to its shadow copies.
							after the values in the original copy change, the original copy dutifully sends the ""update"" request to its shadow copies, but due to some reason the shadow copy does not ""execute"" this update request.
							after the values in the original copy change, the original copy sends the ""update"" request to its shadow copies, and the shadow copy executes this update request faithfully. however, during the small time period when the original copy has ""new"" values and the shadow copy is still holding the ""old"" values, an attacker can exploit the old values. then it becomes a race condition between the attacker and the update process of who can reach the target, shadow copy first, and, if the attacker reaches first, the attacker wins.
							the attacker might send a ""spoofed"" update request to the target shadow copy, pretending that this update request is coming from the original copy. this spoofed request might cause the targeted shadow copy to update its values to some attacker-friendly values, while the original copies remain unchanged by the attacker.
							suppose a situation where the original copy has a system of reverting back to its original value if it does not hear back from all the shadow copies that such copies have successfully completed the update request. in such a case, an attack might occur as follows: (1) the original copy might send an update request; (2) the shadow copy updates it; (3) the shadow copy sends back the successful completion message; (4) through a separate issue, the attacker is able to intercept the shadow copy's completion message. in this case, the original copy thinks that the update did not succeed, hence it reverts to its original value. now there is a situation where the original copy has the ""old"" value, and the shadow copy has the ""new"" value.

				hardware product designs often need to implement memory protection features that enable privileged software to define isolated memory regions and access control (read/write) policies. isolated memory regions can be defined on different memory spaces in a design (e.g. system physical address, virtual address, memory mapped io).
				each memory cell should be mapped and assigned a system address that the core software can use to read/write to that memory. it is possible to map the same memory cell to multiple system addresses such that read/write to any of the aliased system addresses would be decoded to the same memory cell.
				this is commonly done in hardware designs for redundancy and simplifying address decoding logic. if one of the memory regions is corrupted or faulty, then that hardware can switch to using the data in the mirrored memory region. memory aliases can also be created in the system address map if the address decoder unit ignores higher order address bits when mapping a smaller address region into the full system address.
				a common security weakness that can exist in such memory mapping is that aliased memory regions could have different read/write access protections enforced by the hardware such that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing a memory address but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory address. such inconsistency can then be used to bypass the access protection of the primary memory block and read or modify the protected memory.

'meltdown' is a concrete example of how de-synchronization between data and permissions checking logic can violate confidentiality requirements. data loaded from a page marked as privileged was returned to the cpu regardless of current privilege level for performance reasons. the assumption was that the cpu could later remove all traces of this data during the handling of the illegal memory access exception, but this assumption was proven false as traces of the secret data were not removed from the microarchitectural state.

				during the development phase, debug firmware enables many hardware debug hooks, debug modes, and debug messages for testing. those debug facilities provide significant, additional views about the firmware's capability and, in some cases, additional capability into the chip or soc. if compromised, these capabilities could be exploited by an attacker to take full control of the system.
				once the product exits the manufacturing stage and enters production, it is good practice to use a different public key. debug firmware images are known to leak. with the debug key being reused as the production key, the debug image will also work on the production image. thus, it will open all the internal, debug capabilities to the attacker.
				if a different public key is used for the production image, even if the attacker gains access to the debug firmware image, they will not be able to run it on a production machine. thus, damage will be limited to the intellectual property leakage resulting from the debug image.

			  code typically requires ""opening"" handles or references to resources such as memory, files, devices, socket connections, services, etc. when the code is finished with using the resource, it is typically expected to ""close"" or ""release"" the resource, which indicates to the environment (such as the os) that the resource can be re-assigned or reused by unrelated processes or actors - or in some cases, within the same process. api functions or other abstractions are often used to perform this release, such as free() or delete() within c/c++, or file-handle close() operations that are used in many languages.
			  unfortunately, the implementation or design of such apis might expect the developer to be responsible for ensuring that such apis are only called once per release of the resource. if the developer attempts to release the same resource/handle more than once, then the api's expectations are not met, resulting in undefined and/or insecure behavior. this could lead to consequences such as memory corruption, data corruption, execution path corruption, or other consequences.
			  note that while the implementation for most (if not all) resource reservation allocations involve a unique identifier/pointer/symbolic reference, then if this identifier is reused, checking the identifier for resource closure may result in a false state of openness and closing of the wrong resource. for this reason, reuse of identifiers is discouraged.

                    a weakness when the starting state of the volatile memory is
                    being relied upon for a security decision. for example, a

                    biasing caused by inconsistencies in manufacturing and will

				transient execution weaknesses may be exploited using one of two

					that exposes data through a covert channel when it is executed
					transiently (the attacker must also be able to trigger transient
					execution). some transient execution weaknesses can only expose data

					code sequence in a victim program that, when executed transiently, can
					expose data that is architecturally accessible within the victim's

					sequence (see demonstrative example 1). if the attacker can trigger a

			software written in those languages from exposing private data. as a
			second example, software sandboxes may co-locate multiple users'
			software within a single process. the processor's instruction set
			architecture (isa) may permit one user's software to access another
			user's data (because the software shares the same address space), but
			the sandbox prevents these accesses by using software techniques such
			as bounds checking.
			
			if incorrect or stale data can be forwarded (for example, from a
			cache) to transient operations, then the operations'
			microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the data. if an
			attacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side
			effects through a covert channel, then the attacker may be able to
			infer the data. for example, an attacker process may induce transient
			execution in a victim process that causes the victim to inadvertently
			access and then expose its private data via a covert channel. in the
			software sandbox example, an attacker sandbox may induce transient
			execution in its own code, allowing it to transiently access and
			expose data in a victim sandbox that shares the same address space.
			
			consequently, weaknesses that arise from incorrect/stale data
			forwarding might violate users' expectations of software-based memory
			safety and isolation techniques. if the data forwarding behavior is
			not properly documented by the hardware vendor, this might violate the
			software vendor's expectation of how the hardware should behave.

cwe-1423,exposure of sensitive information caused by shared microarchitectural predictor state that influences transient execution,"shared microarchitectural predictor state may allow code to influence
				transient execution across a hardware boundary, potentially exposing
				data that is accessible beyond the boundary over a covert channel.
			","
				many commodity processors have instruction set architecture (isa)
				features that protect software components from one another. these
				features can include memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege
				rings, trusted execution environments, and virtual machines, among
				others. for example, virtual memory provides each process with its own
				address space, which prevents processes from accessing each other's
				private data. many of these features can be used to form
				hardware-enforced security boundaries between software components.
				when separate software components (for example, two processes) share
				microarchitectural predictor state across a hardware boundary, code in
				one component may be able to influence microarchitectural predictor
				behavior in another component. if the predictor can cause transient
				execution, the shared predictor state may allow an attacker to
				influence transient execution in a victim, and in a manner that could
				allow the attacker to infer private data from the victim by monitoring
				observable discrepancies (cwe-203) in a covert channel [ref-1400].
				predictor state may be shared when the processor transitions from one
				component to another (for example, when a process makes a system call
				to enter the kernel). many commodity processors have features which
				prevent microarchitectural predictions that occur before a boundary
				from influencing predictions that occur after the boundary.
				predictor state may also be shared between hardware threads, for
				example, sibling hardware threads on a processor that supports
				simultaneous multithreading (smt). this sharing may be benign if the
				hardware threads are simultaneously executing in the same software
				component, or it could expose a weakness if one sibling is a malicious
				software component, and the other sibling is a victim software
				component. processors that share microarchitectural predictors between
				hardware threads may have features which prevent microarchitectural
				predictions that occur on one hardware thread from influencing
				predictions that occur on another hardware thread.
				features that restrict predictor state sharing across transitions or
				between hardware threads may be always-on, on by default, or may
				require opt-in from software.

            often, functions will return negative values to indicate a failure. when the result of a function is to be used as a size parameter, using these negative return values can have unexpected results. for example, if negative size values are passed to the standard memory copy or allocation functions they will be implicitly cast to a large unsigned value. this may lead to an exploitable buffer overflow or underflow condition.

cwe-200,exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor,the product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.,"
	   there are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. the severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker.  some kinds of sensitive information include:
       
         private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details
         system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages
		 business secrets and intellectual property
		 network status and configuration
		 the product's own code or internal state
         metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers
		 indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider
       
	    information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.  these parties include:
               
                  the product's own users
                  people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users
		  the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates
                  the developer
               
	    information exposures can occur in different ways:
               
                  the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been ""scrubbed"" or ""sanitized""
                  a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.
                  the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. in this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.
               
	    it is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an ""information exposure,"" but this can lead to overuse of cwe-200 in cwe mapping. from the cwe perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read.  cwe-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

        this entry was deprecated for several reasons. the primary
        reason is over-loading of the ""path manipulation"" term and the
        description. the original description for this entry was the
        same as that for the ""often misused: file system"" item in the
        original seven pernicious kingdoms paper. however, seven
        pernicious kingdoms also has a ""path manipulation"" phrase that
        is for external control of pathnames (cwe-73), which is a
        factor in symbolic link following and path traversal, neither
        of which is explicitly mentioned in 7pk. fortify uses the
        phrase ""often misused: path manipulation"" for a broader range
        of problems, generally for issues related to buffer
        management. given the multiple conflicting uses of this term,
        there is a chance that cwe users may have incorrectly mapped
        to this entry.

	the second reason for deprecation is an implied combination of
	multiple weaknesses within buffer-handling functions. the
	focus of this entry was generally on the path-conversion
	functions and their association with buffer
	overflows. however, some of fortify's vulncat entries have the
	term ""path manipulation"" but describe a non-overflow weakness
	in which the buffer is not guaranteed to contain the entire
	pathname, i.e., there is information truncation (see cwe-222
	for a similar concept). a new entry for this non-overflow
	weakness may be created in a future version of cwe.

cwe-301,reflection attack in an authentication protocol,simple authentication protocols are subject to reflection attacks if a malicious user can use the target machine to impersonate a trusted user.,"
		   a mutual authentication protocol requires each party to respond to a random challenge by the other party by encrypting it with a pre-shared key. often, however, such protocols employ the same pre-shared key for communication with a number of different entities. a malicious user or an attacker can easily compromise this protocol without possessing the correct key by employing a reflection attack on the protocol.
            reflection attacks capitalize on mutual authentication schemes in order to trick the target into revealing the secret shared between it and another valid user. in a basic mutual-authentication scheme, a secret is known to both the valid user and the server; this allows them to authenticate. in order that they may verify this shared secret without sending it plainly over the wire, they utilize a diffie-hellman-style scheme in which they each pick a value, then request the hash of that value as keyed by the shared secret. in a reflection attack, the attacker claims to be a valid user and requests the hash of a random value from the server. when the server returns this value and requests its own value to be hashed, the attacker opens another connection to the server. this time, the hash requested by the attacker is the value which the server requested in the first connection. when the server returns this hashed value, it is used in the first connection, authenticating the attacker successfully as the impersonated valid user.

	 many communication channels can be ""sniffed"" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. for example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. as a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.
	 applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote jtag debugging. when mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.

	   a hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:
	   
	     the algorithm is not invertible (also called ""one-way"" or ""not reversible"")
	     the algorithm is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time
	   
	   
	     building on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success at determining any of the following:
	   
	     the original input (preimage attack), given only the digest
	     another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack), given the original input
	     a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times
	   
	   what is regarded as ""reasonable"" varies by context and threat model, but in general, ""reasonable"" could cover any attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half of all possible combinations). note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world.
	   any algorithm that does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing.
	   in addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. for example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a ""rainbow table"" [ref-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as md5, sha-1, and sha-2.

		   prngs are deterministic and, while their output appears

		   cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so
		   proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the
		   prng.

		   (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from
		   a cryptographically secure source
			 
		   
			 
			   prngs require a seed as input to generate a stream of
			   numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from
			   random numbers.  while the output is, in many cases,
			   sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any
			   prng is directly determined by the seed provided as
			   input. if the seed can be ascertained by a third party,
			   the entire output of the prng can be made known to
			   them. as such, the seed should be kept secret and
			   should ideally not be able to be guessed. for example,
			   the current time may be a poor seed. knowing the
			   approximate time the prng was seeded greatly reduces
			   the possible key space.
			 
			 
			   seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered.

cwe-362,concurrent execution using shared resource with improper synchronization ('race condition'),"the product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.","
            a race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.
            a race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:
               
                  exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.
                  atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.
               
            a race condition exists when an ""interfering code sequence"" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.
            the interfering code sequence could be ""trusted"" or ""untrusted."" a trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. an untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

cwe-364,signal handler race condition,the product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.,"
            race conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. these race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.
            these issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. these behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the ""regular"" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. if these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. even if a given pointer is set to null after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to null. this is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.
            there are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of ""signal handler race condition"":
            
              shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and ""regular"" code
              shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers
              use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. for example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.
              association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. for example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.
              use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality
              while not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.
            
            signal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in cwe because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:
            
              avoiding shared state
              using synchronization in the signal handler
              using synchronization in the regular code
              disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)

                  in various unix and linux-based systems, the path environment variable may be consulted to locate executable programs, and ld_preload may be used to locate a separate library.
                  in various microsoft-based systems, the path environment variable is consulted to locate a dll, if the dll is not found in other paths that appear earlier in the search order.

cwe-427,uncontrolled search path element,"the product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.","
            although this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as ""/tmp"" or the current working directory.
            in windows-based systems, when the loadlibrary or loadlibraryex function is called with a dll name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:
               
                  the directory from which the program has been loaded
                  the current working directory
               
            in some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when smb or webdav network shares are used.
	    one or more locations in that path could include the windows drive root or its subdirectories. this often exists in linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory.  in windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.
            in some unix-based systems, a path might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the path. this empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.
            in software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, rubygems, or pypi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. the framework may search a public repository before a private repository. this could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. the search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.

         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two
         entities such as a client and server, but it does not
         interpret malformed http requests or responses in ways that
         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by
         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.","
	   http requests or responses (""messages"") can be
	   malformed or unexpected in ways that cause web servers or
	   clients to interpret the messages in different ways than
	   intermediary http agents such as load balancers, reverse
	   proxies, web caching proxies, application firewalls,
	   etc. for example, an adversary may be able to add duplicate
	   or different header fields that a client or server might
	   interpret as one set of messages, whereas the intermediary
	   might interpret the same sequence of bytes as a different
	   set of messages. for example, discrepancies can arise in
	   how to handle duplicate headers like two transfer-encoding
	   (te) or two content-length (cl), or the malicious http
	   message will have different headers for te and
	   cl.
	   the inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages
	   can allow the adversary to ""smuggle"" a message to the
	   client/server without the intermediary being aware of it.
	   this weakness is usually the result of the usage
	   of outdated or incompatible http protocol versions in the
	   http agents.

cwe-451,user interface (ui) misrepresentation of critical information,"the user interface (ui) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. this is often a component in phishing attacks.","
            if an attacker can cause the ui to display erroneous data, or to otherwise convince the user to display information that appears to come from a trusted source, then the attacker could trick the user into performing the wrong action. this is often a component in phishing attacks, but other kinds of problems exist. for example, if the ui is used to monitor the security state of a system or network, then omitting or obscuring an important indicator could prevent the user from detecting and reacting to a security-critical event.
            ui misrepresentation can take many forms:
               
                  incorrect indicator: incorrect information is displayed, which prevents the user from understanding the true state of the product or the environment the product is monitoring, especially of potentially-dangerous conditions or operations. this can be broken down into several different subtypes.
                  overlay: an area of the display is intended to give critical information, but another process can modify the display by overlaying another element on top of it. the user is not interacting with the expected portion of the user interface. this is the problem that enables clickjacking attacks, although many other types of attacks exist that involve overlay.
                  icon manipulation: the wrong icon, or the wrong color indicator, can be influenced (such as making a dangerous .exe executable look like a harmless .gif)
                  timing: the product is performing a state transition or context switch that is presented to the user with an indicator, but a race condition can cause the wrong indicator to be used before the product has fully switched context. the race window could be extended indefinitely if the attacker can trigger an error.
                  visual truncation: important information could be truncated from the display, such as a long filename with a dangerous extension that is not displayed in the gui because the malicious portion is truncated. the use of excessive whitespace can also cause truncation, or place the potentially-dangerous indicator outside of the user's field of view (e.g. ""filename.txt .exe""). a different type of truncation can occur when a portion of the information is removed due to reasons other than length, such as the accidental insertion of an end-of-input marker in the middle of an input, such as a nul byte in a c-style string.
                  visual distinction: visual information might be presented in a way that makes it difficult for the user to quickly and correctly distinguish between critical and unimportant segments of the display.
                  homographs: letters from different character sets, fonts, or languages can appear very similar (i.e. may be visually equivalent) in a way that causes the human user to misread the text (for example, to conduct phishing attacks to trick a user into visiting a malicious web site with a visually-similar name as a trusted site). this can be regarded as a type of visual distinction issue.

            a separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. if the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.

            if a message is malformed, it may cause the message to be incorrectly interpreted.
            neutralization is an abstract term for any technique that ensures that input (and output) conforms with expectations and is ""safe.""  this can be done by:
	    
	      checking that the input/output is already ""safe"" (e.g. validation)
	      transformation of the input/output to be ""safe"" using techniques such as filtering, encoding/decoding, escaping/unescaping, quoting/unquoting, or canonicalization
	      preventing the input/output from being directly provided by an attacker (e.g. ""indirect selection"" that maps externally-provided values to internally-controlled values)
	      preventing the input/output from being processed at all
	    
            this weakness typically applies in cases where the product prepares a control message that another process must act on, such as a command or query, and malicious input that was intended as data, can enter the control plane instead. however, this weakness also applies to more general cases where there are not always control implications.

cwe-828,signal handler with functionality that is not asynchronous-safe,"the product defines a signal handler that contains code sequences that are not asynchronous-safe, i.e., the functionality is not reentrant, or it can be interrupted.","
            this can lead to an unexpected system state with a variety of potential consequences depending on context, including denial of service and code execution.
            signal handlers are typically intended to interrupt normal functionality of a program, or even other signals, in order to notify the process of an event. when a signal handler uses global or static variables, or invokes functions that ultimately depend on such state or its associated metadata, then it could corrupt system state that is being used by normal functionality. this could subject the program to race conditions or other weaknesses that allow an attacker to cause the program state to be corrupted. while denial of service is frequently the consequence, in some cases this weakness could be leveraged for code execution.
            there are several different scenarios that introduce this issue:
               
                  invocation of non-reentrant functions from within the handler. one example is malloc(), which modifies internal global variables as it manages memory. very few functions are actually reentrant.
                  code sequences (not necessarily function calls) contain non-atomic use of global variables, or associated metadata or structures, that can be accessed by other functionality of the program, including other signal handlers. frequently, the same function is registered to handle multiple signals.
                  the signal handler function is intended to run at most one time, but instead it can be invoked multiple times. this could happen by repeated delivery of the same signal, or by delivery of different signals that have the same handler function (cwe-831).

            this might lead to many different consequences depending on the included functionality, but some examples include injection of malware, information exposure by granting excessive privileges or permissions to the untrusted functionality, dom-based xss vulnerabilities, stealing user's cookies, or open redirect to malware (cwe-601).

            this weakness is common in ""mashup"" development on the web, which may include source functionality from other domains. for example, javascript-based web widgets may be inserted by using '<script src=""http://other.domain.here"">' tags, which causes the code to run in the domain of the product, not the remote site from which the widget was loaded. as a result, the included code has access to the local dom, including cookies and other data that the developer might not want the remote site to be able to access.

            while sometimes intentional and safe, when the same function is used to handle multiple signals, a race condition could occur if the function uses any state outside of its local declaration, such as global variables or non-reentrant functions, or has any side effects.
            an attacker could send one signal that invokes the handler function; in many oses, this will typically prevent the same signal from invoking the handler again, at least until the handler function has completed execution. however, the attacker could then send a different signal that is associated with the same handler function. this could interrupt the original handler function while it is still executing. if there is shared state, then the state could be corrupted. this can lead to a variety of potential consequences depending on context, including denial of service and code execution.
            another rarely-explored possibility arises when the signal handler is only designed to be executed once (if at all). by sending multiple signals, an attacker could invoke the function more than once. this may generate extra, unintended side effects. a race condition might not even be necessary; the attacker could send one signal, wait until it is handled, then send the other signal.

            this weakness can cause the downstream component to use a decoding method that produces different data than what the product intended to send. when the wrong encoding is used - even if closely related - the downstream component could decode the data incorrectly. this can have security consequences when the provided boundaries between control and data are inadvertently broken, because the resulting data could introduce control characters or special elements that were not sent by the product. the resulting data could then be used to bypass protection mechanisms such as input validation, and enable injection attacks.
            while using output encoding is essential for ensuring that communications between components are accurate, the use of the wrong encoding - even if closely related - could cause the downstream component to misinterpret the output.
            for example, html entity encoding is used for elements in the html body of a web page. however, a programmer might use entity encoding when generating output for that is used within an attribute of an html tag, which could contain functional javascript that is not affected by the html encoding.

            some products use signed integers or floats even when their values are only expected to be positive or 0. an input validation check might assume that the value is positive, and only check for the maximum value. if the value is negative, but the code assumes that the value is positive, this can produce an error. the error may have security consequences if the negative value is used for memory allocation, array access, buffer access, etc. ultimately, the error could lead to a buffer overflow or other type of memory corruption.
            the use of a negative number in a positive-only context could have security implications for other types of resources. for example, a shopping cart might check that the user is not requesting more than 10 items, but a request for -3 items could cause the application to calculate a negative price and credit the attacker's account.

            for example, a file-sharing protocol might require that an actor perform separate steps to provide a username, then a password, before being able to transfer files. if the file-sharing server accepts a password command followed by a transfer command, without any username being provided, the product might still perform the transfer.

            many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. in this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.
            many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. however, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. if an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as sql injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and gpu, asic, or fpga hardware. in such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.

                  if access to an exported service is not restricted, any application may start and bind to the service. depending on the exposed functionality, this may allow a malicious application to perform unauthorized actions, gain access to sensitive information, or corrupt the internal state of the application.

            since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an intent filter for that intent. this can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. there are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.
            ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the receivers. a malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. there is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the intent before passing it on to the next receiver. the downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.
            sticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. an old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.
            in addition, any broadcast intent may include a uri that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. the sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific uri included in the intent. a malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified uri.

            when a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.
            injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. for this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. the most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. this means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. while buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. the most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are sql injection and format string vulnerabilities.

            attackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service.
            there are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination:
               
                  if the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. for example, because udp is a connectionless protocol, udp packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. the server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (ddos). as another example, server-side request forgery (ssrf) and xml external entity (xxe) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.
                  if the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. while the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. for example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or ip address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. as another example, an android application may use a ""sticky broadcast"" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.

cwe-942,permissive cross-domain policy with untrusted domains,the product uses a cross-domain policy file that includes domains that should not be trusted.,"
            a cross-domain policy file (""crossdomain.xml"" in flash and ""clientaccesspolicy.xml"" in silverlight) defines a list of domains from which a server is allowed to make cross-domain requests. when making a cross-domain request, the flash or silverlight client will first look for the policy file on the target server. if it is found, and the domain hosting the application is explicitly allowed to make requests, the request is made.
            therefore, if a cross-domain policy file includes domains that should not be trusted, such as when using wildcards, then the application could be attacked by these untrusted domains.
            an overly permissive policy file allows many of the same attacks seen in cross-site scripting (cwe-79). once the user has executed a malicious flash or silverlight application, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. the attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. the attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site.
            in many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

            depending on the capabilities of the query language, an attacker could inject additional logic into the query to:
               
                  modify the intended selection criteria, thus changing which data entities (e.g., records) are returned, modified, or otherwise manipulated
                  append additional commands to the query
                  return more entities than intended
                  return fewer entities than intended
                  cause entities to be sorted in an unexpected way
               
            the ability to execute additional commands or change which entities are returned has obvious risks. but when the product logic depends on the order or number of entities, this can also lead to vulnerabilities. for example, if the query expects to return only one entity that specifies an administrative user, but an attacker can change which entities are returned, this could cause the logic to return information for a regular user and incorrectly assume that the user has administrative privileges.
            while this weakness is most commonly associated with sql injection, there are many other query languages that are also subject to injection attacks, including htsql, ldap, dql, xquery, xpath, and ""nosql"" languages.
